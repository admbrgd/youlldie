# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to the youlldie project.

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.

# Reasons for making the project open source

1. To be fully transparent with the calculations performed and the number generated by the app. If you disagrees with the numbers that the app generates, you have the opportunity to see exactly how those numbers were generated. If you wants to challenge the calculations, you can do so by contributing to the project. Namely, by opening and issue for the youlldie repository and making a suggested enhancement (link).  

2. To benefit from contributions from people from different fields. That is, predicting age and cause of death needs to take a lot of factors into consideration. There are also different ways those factors can be analyzed statistically to draw conclusions on their impact on age and cause of death (classical vs baysian). There is also a lot of evolving scientific litterature and databases that provide inputs into the model. There are also different ways the numbers can be displayed in a user friendly, informative way. As such, the viability of the model depends on continuous contributions from people like you. 

# The types of contributions we are looking for

We are looking for contributions that involve updates of R Shiny app code in the following situations:
* If you believe the calculations should be performed differently
* If you are aware of current scientific litterature that suggest different numbers should be used as inputs
* If you find an error in the code

# How to suggest an update to the R Shiny app code

When making updates to the code, please open a pull request with your contribution.

Please include a comment in your pull request indicating the rationale for the update.

Please provide reference for your claims (WHERE??? in the reason for change field) and make sure it is peer-reviewed material.

There are many factors have an impact on age and cause of death. The factors that are suggested for the calculation of age and cause of death must be factors that have the significant impact on age and causes of death and must be a factor that most users are able to provide an input on.

# Where can I get help

*Create a GitHub user forum for the community to talk

# Your roadmap or vision for the project

The goal is to develop and continuously improve on a tool that predicts age and cause of death based on inherited risk factor and lifestyle choices and make this tool available to the general public to provide a realistic perspective on death and encourage users to adopt healthy lifestyles.

This project was brought about with the opinion that the realization of your own death is one of the most beneficial influence on your general quality of life. Althought the app's output may scare or make one angry, the realization of one's death is a seed that has an overall positive impact. 

The purpose is to make people aware. Not to make them panic.
